      "content": "In Indian law, culpable homicide is defined under Section 299 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), 1860. It refers to an act of causing death by doing something with the intention of causing death, or with the knowledge that it is likely to cause death, but without the intention of causing death.\n\nTo constitute culpable homicide, the following elements must be present:\n\n1. The act must be done with the intention of causing death, or\n2. The act must be done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause death, and\n3. The act must result in the death of the person.\n\nCulpable homicide is a broader term that encompasses various forms of homicide, including murder. However, not all culpable homicides are considered murder. The distinction between culpable homicide and murder lies in the presence of certain circumstances, such as the intention to cause death, the severity of the injury, and the presence of any exceptions or justifications.\n\nSection 299 of the IPC states: \"Whoever causes death by doing anything with the intention of causing death, or with the intention of causing bodily injury which is likely to cause death, or with the knowledge that he is thereby likely to cause death, commits the offence of culpable homicide.\"\n\nIt is essential to note that the distinction between culpable homicide and murder is crucial, as the punishment and consequences for each offence differ significantly.\n\nDisclaimer: This information is provided for general knowledge purposes only and should not be considered as professional legal advice.
